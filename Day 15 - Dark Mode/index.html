  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Hi, welcome to my JavaScript tutorial! <br><br>

    Throughout this tutorial you will learn the basics of JavaScript, an essential programming language for web development (many parts of this somewhat interactive tutorial are actually made with JavaScript!).
    <br><br>
    In this tutorial, we'll look at data types, variables, logic, loops and functions. If you ever want to learn more, two great places to start your search are MDN and W3Schools.
    <br><br>
    If you're ever stuck or confused, feel free to ask questions here!
    <br><br>
    Well? What are you waiting for? Jump right in!
